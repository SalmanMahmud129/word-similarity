import { ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx'
import {twMerge} from 'tailwind-merge'

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
    return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}

// This is a TypeScript/JavaScript function that uses the clsx and tailwind-merge packages to merge CSS class names together. The resulting function cn takes any number of class names or arrays of class names and returns a merged string of class names.

// The clsx function is used to join multiple class names and arrays of class names together, while ignoring any falsy values (such as empty strings, undefined, null, and false). The twMerge function from tailwind-merge package is used to merge the tailwind classes together, so that any classes that are defined in tailwind.config.js get merged correctly.

// For example, if you call cn('text-red-500', 'bg-blue-500', ['border', 'border-gray-500']), the output will be the string "text-red-500 bg-blue-500 border border-gray-500", which can then be used as a className prop in a React component to style it with Tailwind CSS.

// Overall, this code simplifies the process of combining class names and tailwind classes for React components and can help to make the code more readable and maintainable.
